    <h1>Responsive Design</h1>
    <p>
      Responsive web design is fundamental to designing web pages in 2017.  
    </p>
    <p>
      10 years ago, web programmers coded websites to cater to a desktop internet experience. There was little need to take into consideration displays that were different sizes, because mobile phones with internet did not exist. As the use of these mobile internet-machines has exploded, web programmers have been forced to code their websites in a way that provides a meaningful user experience no matter which device is being used. Web programmers are now able to create one website that will show a different version of the website depending on the size of the user's display. This is known as responsive web design.  
    </p>
    <p>
      However, responsive web design did not become a standard until very recently. Web developers initially tried to solve the "mobile problem" by creating 2 versions of their websites. One would cater to mobile users and one would cater to desktop users. This was inefficient, because they had to essentially host the content in two different places. Luckily, responsive web design allows you to create one design that will adjust to work well on any type of device.
